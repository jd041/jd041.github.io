# Pintos

Welcome to Pintos. Pintos is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system in a very simple way. In the Pintos projects, My project team and I strengthened its support in all three of these areas. I also added a virtual memory implementation.

#### Project descriptions, design documents, and final reports are included in the googld drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ljKJaOEDG-NJsVtgqRMh0nyfdkOSSqcs?usp=share_link).
