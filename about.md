<p>I am passionate about deep learning. Previously, I was an undergraduate research assistant at RISELab under the supervision of professor Joseph Gonzalez and PhD candidate Nathan Pemberton. I worked on the KaaS(Kernel as a Service) project. Now, I am working on deep learning for code vulnerability detection.</p>
